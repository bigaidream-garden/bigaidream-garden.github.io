<h3 id="learning-is-misunderstood">Learning is Misunderstood</h3>
<p><strong>Claims We Make in This Book</strong> - Learning is deeper and more durable when
it&rsquo;s <strong>effortful</strong>. - we are <strong>poor judges</strong> of when we are learning well
and when we&rsquo;re not. When the going is harder and slower and it doesn&rsquo;t
feel productive, we are drawn to strategies that feel more fruitful,
unaware that the gains from these strategies are often temporary. -
<strong>Rereading text</strong> and <strong>massed practice</strong> of a skill or new knowledge are
by far the preferred study strategies of learners of all stripes, but
they&rsquo;re also among the <strong>least productive</strong>. - <strong>Retrieval practice</strong>
&ndash;recalling facts or concepts or events from memory&ndash;is a more effective
learning strategy than review by rereading. Flashcards are a simple
example. A single, simple quiz after reading a text or hearing a lecture
produces better learning and remembering than rereading the text or
reviewing lecture notes. <code>Periodic</code> practice arrests forgetting,
strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the
knowledge you want to gain. - When you <strong>space out practice</strong> at a task
and get a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice
of two or more subjects, retrieval is harder and feels less productive,
but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables more
versatile application of it in later settings. - Trying to solve a
problem <strong>before being taught the solution</strong> leads to better learning,
even when errors are made in the attempt. - When you&rsquo;are adept at
extracting the underlying principles or &ldquo;rules&rdquo; that differentiate types
of problems, you&rsquo;re more successful at picking the right solutions in
unfamiliar situations. This skill is better acquired through
<strong>interleaved and varied practice</strong> than massed practice. - Testing helps
calibrate our judgments of what we&rsquo;ve learned. - All new learning
requires a <strong>foundation of prior knowledge</strong>. - If you are just engaging
in mechanical repetition, you quickly hit the limit of what you can keep
in mind. However, if you practice <strong>elaboration</strong>, there&rsquo;s no known limit
to how much you can learn. <code>Elaboration</code> is the process of giving new
material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it
with what you already know. The more you can explain about the way your
new learning relates to your prior knowledge, the stronger your grasp of
the new learning will be, and the more connections you create that will
help you remember it later. - Putting new knowledge into a <strong>larger
context</strong> helps learning. - People who learn to <strong>extract the key ideas
from new material and organize them into a mental model</strong> and connect the
model to prior knowledge show an advantage in learning complex
mastery. - Many people believe that their intellectual ability is
hardwired from birth, and that failure to meet a learning challenge is
an indictment of their native ability. But every time you learn
something new, <em>you change the brain</em> &ndash;the residue of your experiences
is stored.</p>

<h3 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h3>
<p><strong>Practice at retrieving new knowledge or skill from memory is a potent
tool for learning and durable retention.</strong> <strong>Effortful retrieval</strong> makes
for stronger learning and retention. The greater the effort to retrieve
learning, provided that you succeed, the more that learning is
strengthened by retrieval. After an initial test, <strong>delaying subsequent
retrieval practice</strong> is more potent for reinforcing retention than
immediate practice, because delayed retrieval requires more effort.
<strong>Repeated retrieval</strong> not only makes memories more durable but produces
knowledge that can be retrieved more readily, in more varied settings,
and applied to a wider variety of problems. While cramming can produce
better scores on an immediate exam, the advantage quickly fades because
there is much greater forgetting after retreading than after retrieval
practice. The benefits of retrieval practice are <strong>long-term</strong>. <strong>Simply
including one test</strong> (retrieval practice) in a class yields a large
improvement in final exam scores, and gains continue to increase as the
frequency of classroom testing increases. <strong>Testing doesn&rsquo;t need to be
initiated by the instructor</strong>. Students can practice retrieval anywhere;
no quizzes in the classroom are necessary. Think flashcards &ndash; the way
second graders learn the multiplication tables can work just as well for
learners at any age to quiz themselves on anatomy, mathematics, or law.
Self-testing may be unappealing because it takes more effort than
rereading, but as noted already, the greater the effort at retrieval,
the more will be retained. Students who take practice testes have <strong>a
better grasp of their progress</strong> than those who simply reread the
material. Giving students <strong>corrective feedback</strong> after tests keeps them
from incorrectly retaining material they have misunderstood and produces
better learning of the correct answers.</p>
<h2 id="ch3-mix-up-your-practice">Ch3, Mix Up Your Practice</h2>
<h3 id="the-myth-of-massed-practice">The Myth of Massed Practice</h3>
<p>If learning can be defined as picking up new knowledge or skills and
being able to apply them later, then how <code>quickly</code> you pick something up
is only part of the story. Is it *still there *when you need to use it
out in the everyday world?</p>
<p>Practice is far more effective when it&rsquo;s broken into separate periods of
training that are spaced out. Practice that&rsquo;s spaced out, interleaved
with other learning, and varied produces better mastery, longer
retention, and more versatility. But these benefits come at a price:
when practice is spaced, interleaved, and varied, it requires more
effort.</p>
<h3 id="spaced-practice">Spaced Practice</h3>
<p>Why is spaced practice more effective than massed practice? It appears
that embedding new learning in long-term memory requires a process of
consolidation, in which memory traces (the brain&rsquo;s representations of
the new learning) are strengthened, given meaning, and connected to
prior knowledge - a process that unfolds over hours and may take several
days.</p>
<h3 id="interleaved-practice">Interleaved Practice</h3>
<p>Interleaving the practice of two or more subjects or skills is also a
more potent alternative to massed practice, and here&rsquo;s a quick example
of that. Two groups of college students were taught how to find the
volumes of four obscure geometric solids (wedge, spheroid, spherical
cone, and half cone). One group then worked a set of practice problems
that were clustered by problem type (practice four problems for
computing the volume of a wedge, then four problems for a spheroid,
etc.). The other group worked the same practice problems, but the
sequence was mixed (interleaved) rather than clustered by type of
problem. During practice, the students who worked the problems in
clusters (that is, massed) averaged 89 percent correct, compared to only
60 percent for those who worked the problems in a mixed sequence. But in
the final test a week later, the students who had practiced solving
problems clustered by type averaged only 20 percent correct, while the
students whose practice was interleaved averaged 63 percent.</p>
<p>Now, suppose you &rsquo;re a trainer in a company trying to teach employees a
complicated new process that involves ten procedures. They typical way
of doing this is to train up in procedure 1, repreating it many times
until the trainess really seem to have it down cold. Then you go to
procedure 2, you do many repetitions of 2, you get that down, and so on.
That appears to produce fast learning. What would interleaved practice
look like? You practice procedure 1 just a few times, then switch to
procedure 4, then switch to 3, then to 7, and so on.</p>
<p>Research shows unequivocally that mastery and long-term retention are
much better if you interleave practice than if you mass it.</p>
<h3 id="varied-practice">Varied Practice</h3>
<h3 id="developing-discrimination-skills">Developing Discrimination Skills</h3>
<p>Compared to massed practice, a significant advantage of interleaving and
variation is that they help us learn better how to assess context and
discriminate between problems, selecting and applying the correct
solution from a range of possibilities.</p>

<h3 id="these-principles-are-broadly-applicable">These Principles Are Broadly Applicable</h3>
<h3 id="the-takeaway-1">The Takeaway</h3>
<p>The simple act of spacing out study and practice in installments and
allowing time to elapse between them makes both the learning and the
memory stronger, in effect building habit strength. How big an interval,
you ask? The simple answer: enough so that practice doesn&rsquo;t become a
mindless repetition. At a minimum, enough time so that a little
forgetting has set in. A little forgetting between practice sessions can
be a good thing, if it leads to more effort in practice, but you do not
want so much forgetting that retrieval essentially involves relearning
the material. The time periods between sessions of practice let memories
consolidate.</p>
<p>Something as simple as a deck of flashcards can provide an example of
spacing.</p>
<p><strong>Beware of the familiarity trap:</strong> the feeling that you know something
and no longer need to practice it. The familiarity can hurt you during
self-quizzing if you take shortcuts. You have to be disciplined to say,
&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m going to make myself recall all of this and if I don&rsquo;t,
what did I miss, how did I not know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>*Interleaving *two or more subjects during practice also provides a form
of spacing. Interleaving can also help you develop your ability to
<strong>discriminate</strong> later between different kinds of problems and select the
right tool from your growing toolkit of solutions.</p>
<p>In interleaving, you don&rsquo;t move from a complete practice set of one
topic to go to another. You <strong>switch before each practice is complete</strong> .A
friend of ours describes his own experience with this: &ldquo;I go to a hockey
class and we&rsquo;re learning skating skills, puck handling, shooting, and I
notice that I get frustrated because we do a little bit of skating and
just when I think I&rsquo;m getting it, we go to stick handling, and I go home
frustrated, saying, &lsquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t this guy keep letting us do these
things until we get it?'&rdquo; This is actually the rare coach who
understands that it&rsquo;s more effective to distribute practice across these
different skills than polish each one in turn.</p>
<p>Like interleaving, <strong>varied practice</strong> helps learners build a broad
schema, an ability to asses changing conditions and adjust responses to
fit. Arguably, interleaving and variation help learners reach beyond
memorization to higher levels of conceptual learning and application,
building more rounded, deep, and durable learning, what in motor skills
shows up as underlying habit strength.</p>

<h3 id="how-learning-occurs">How Learning Occurs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Encoding</li>
<li>Consolidation</li>
<li>Retrieval Durable, robust learning requires that we do two things.
First, as we recode and consolidate new material from short-term
memory into long-term memory, we must anchor it here securely. Second,
we must associate the material with a diverse set of cues that will
make us adept at recalling the knowledge later.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extending-learning-updating-retrieval-cues">Extending Learning: Updating Retrieval Cues</h3>
<p>Knowledge is more durable if it&rsquo;s <code>deeply entrenched</code>, meaning that you
have firmly and thoroughly comprehended a concept, it has practical
importance or keen emotional weight in your life, and it is connected
with other knowledge that you hold in memory. The parodox is that some
forgetting is often essential for new learning.</p>
<h3 id="easier-isnt-better">Easier Isn&rsquo;t Better</h3>
<p>The easier knowledge or a skill is for you to retrieve, the less your
retrieval practice will benefit your retention of it. Conversely, the
more effort you have to expend to retrieve knowledge or skill, the more
the practice of retrieval will entrench it.</p>
<h3 id="how-effort-helps">How Effort Helps</h3>
<h4 id="reconsolidating-memory">Reconsolidating Memory</h4>
<p>Effortful recall of learning, as happens in spaced practice, requires
that you <code>reload</code> or reconstruct the components of the skill or material
anew from long-term memory rather than mindlessly repeating them from
short-term memory.</p>
<p>The more effort that is required to recall a memory or to execute a
skill, provided that the effort succeeds, the more the act of recalling
or executing benefits the learning.</p>
<p>Massed practice gives us the warm sensation of mastery because we&rsquo;re
looping information through short-term memory without having to
reconstruct the learning from long-term memory.</p>
<h4 id="creating-mental-models">Creating Mental Models</h4>
<h4 id="broadening-mastery">Broadening Mastery</h4>
<p>Retrieval practice that you perform at different times and in different
contexts and that interleaves different learning material has the
benefit of linking new associations to the material.</p>
<h4 id="fostering-conceptual-learning">Fostering Conceptual Learning</h4>
<p>The difficulty produced by interleaving provides a second type of boost
to learning. Interleaved practice of related but dissimilar geometric
solids requires that you notice similarities and differences in order to
select the correct formula for computing the volume.</p>
<h4 id="improving-versatility">Improving Versatility</h4>
<p>The retrieval difficulties posed by spacing, interleaving, and variation
are overcome by invoking the same mental processes that will be needed
later in applying the learning in everyday settings. By mimicking the
challenges of practical experience, these learning strategies conform to
the admonition to &ldquo;practice like you play, and you&rsquo;ll play like you
practice,&rdquo; improving what scientists call transfer of learning, which is
the ability to apply what you&rsquo;ve learned in new settings.</p>
<h4 id="priming-the-mind-for-learning">Priming the Mind for Learning</h4>
<p>When you&rsquo;re asked to struggle with solving a problem before being shown
how to solve it, the subsequent solution is better learned and more
surably remembered.</p>
<h3 id="other-learning-strategies-that-incorporate-desirable-difficulties">Other Learning Strategies That Incorporate Desirable Difficulties</h3>
<p>We usually think of interference as a detriment to learning, but certain
kinds of interference can produce learning benefits, and the positive
effects are sometimes surprising.</p>
<p>When letters are omitted from words in a text, requiring the reader to
supply them, reading is slowed, and retention improves. The added effort
increases comprehension and learning. (Of course, learning will not
improve if the difficulty completely obscures the meaning or cannot be
overcome.)</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re asked to supply an answer or a solution to something that&rsquo;s
new to you, the power of generation to aid learning is even more
evident. One explanation for this effect is the idea that as you cast
about for a solution, retrieving related knowledge from memory, you
strengthen the route to a gap in your learning even before the answer is
provided to fill it and, when you do fill it, connections are made to
the related material that is fresh in your mind from the effort. It&rsquo;s
better to solve a problem than to memorize a solution. It&rsquo;s better to
attempt a solution and supply the incorrect answer than not to make the
attempt.</p>
<p>The act of taking a few minutes to review what has been learned from an
experience (or in a recent class) and asking yourself questions is know
as <code>reflection</code>. After a lecture or reading assignment, for example, you
might ask yourself: What are the key ideas? What are some examples? How
do these relate to what I already know?</p>
<p>One form of reflection that is gaining currency in classroom settings is
called &ldquo;write to learn.&rdquo; In essence, students reflect on a recent class
topic in a brief writing assignment, where they may express the main
ideas in their own words and relate them to other concepts covered in
class, or perhaps outside class.</p>
<h3 id="failure-and-the-myth-of-errorless-learning">Failure and the Myth of Errorless Learning</h3>
<p>People who are taught that learning is a struggle that often involves
making errors will go on to exhibit a greater propensity to tackle tough
challenges and will tend to see mistakes not as failures but as lessons
and turning points along the path to mastery.</p>
<p>Studies underscore the importance of learners understanding that
difficulty in learning new things is not only to be expected but can be
beneficial. It&rsquo;s trusting that trying to solve a puzzle serves us better
than being spoon-fed the solution, even if we fall short in our first
attempts at an answer.</p>
<h3 id="an-example-of-generative-learning">An Example of Generative Learning</h3>
<h3 id="undesirable-difficulties">Undesirable Difficulties</h3>
<p><code>Desirable difficulties</code> are desirable because they trigger encoding and
retrieval processes that support learning, comprehension, and
remembering. If, however, the learners does not have the background
knowledge or skills to respond to them successfully, they become
undesirable difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="the-takeaway-2">The Takeaway</h3>
<p>Learning is at least a three-step process: 1. Initial encoding of
information is held in short-term working memory before being
consolidated into a cohesive representation of knowledge in long-term
memory. 2. Consolidation reorganizes and stabilizes memory traces, gives
them meaning, and makes connections to past experiences and to other
knowledge already stored in long-term memory. 3. Retrieval updates
learning and enables you to apply it when you need it.</p>
<p>Learning always builds on a store of prior knowledge. We interpret and
remember events by building connections to what we already know.</p>
<p>Long-term memory capacity is virtually limitless: the more you know, the
more possible connections you have for adding new knowledge.</p>
<p>Periodic retrieval of learning helps strengthen connections to the
memory and the cues for recalling it, while also weakening routes to
competing memories. Retrieval practice that&rsquo;s easy does little to
strengthen learning; the more difficult the practice, the greater the
benefit.</p>
<p>When you recall learning from short-term memory, as in rapid-fire
practice, little mental effort is required, and little long-term benefit
accrues. But when you recall it after some time has elapsed and your
grasp of it has become a little rusty, you have to make an effort to
reconstruct it. This effortful retrieval both strengthens the memory but
also makes the learning pliable again, leading to its reconsolidation.</p>
<p>Reconsolidation helps update your memories with new information and
connect them to more recent learning.</p>
<p>Repeated effortful recall or practice helps integrate learning into
mental models, in which a set of interrelated ideas or a sequence of
motor skills are fused into a meaningful whole that can be adapted and
applied in later settings. When practice conditions are varied or
retrieval is interleaved with the practice of other material, we
increase our abilities of discrimination and induction and the
versatility with which we can apply the learning in new settings at a
later date. Interleaving and variation build new connections, expanding
and more firmly entrenching knowledge in memory and increasing the
number of cues for retrieval.</p>
<p>Trying to come up with an answer rather than having it presented to you,
or trying to solve a problem before being shown the solution, leads to
better learning and longer retention of the correct answer or solution,
even when your attempted response is wrong, so long as corrective
feedback is provided.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that everyone has learning preferences, but we are not

those preferences. Yet there are other kinds of differences in how
people learn that do matter.</p>
<h3 id="active-learning-from-the-get-go">Active Learning from the Get-Go</h3>
<p>One difference that appears to matter a lot is how you see yourself and
your abilities. Whether you think you can or you think you cannot,
you&rsquo;re right. Each of us has a large basket of resources in the form of
aptitudes, prior knowledge, intelligence, interests, and sense of
personal empowerment that shape how we learn and how we overcome our
shortcomings. Some of these differences matter a lot - for example, our
ability to abstract underlying principles from new experiences and to
convert new knowledge into mental structures. Other differences we may
think count for a lot, for example having a verbal or visual learning
style, actually don&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="successful-intelligence">Successful Intelligence</h3>
<h3 id="dynamic-testing">Dynamic Testing</h3>
<p>A test may assess a weakness, but rather than assuming that the weakness
indicates a fixed inability, you interpret it as a lack of skill or
knowledge that can be remedied. What do I need to learn in order to
improve? Dynamic testing has three steps: 1. A test of some kind -
perhaps an experience or a paper exam - shows me where I come up short
in knowledge or a skill. 2. I dedicate myself to becoming more
competent, using reflection, practice, spacing, and the other techniques
of effective learning. 3. I test myself again, paying attention to what
works better now but also, and especially, to where I still need more
work.</p>
<h3 id="structure-building">Structure Building</h3>
<p>There do appear to be cognitive differences in how we learn, though not
the ones recommended by advocates of learning styles. One of these
differences is the idea mentioned earlier that psychologists call
structure building: the act, as we encounter new material, of extracting
the salient ideas and constructing a coherent mental framework out of
them. These frameworks are sometimes called mental models or mental
maps. High structure-builders learn new material better than low
structure-builders. The theory of structure building bears some
resemblance to a village built of Lego blocks. We know that when
questions are embedded in texts to help focus readers on the main ideas,
the learning performance of low structure-builders improves to a level
commensurate with high structure-builders.</p>
<h3 id="rule-versus-example-learning">Rule versus Example Learning</h3>
<p>We know that high structure-builders and rule learners are more
successful in transferring their learning to unfamiliar situations than
are low structure-builders and example learners.</p>
<h3 id="the-takeaway-3">The Takeaway</h3>
<p><code>Be the one in charge</code> There&rsquo;s an old truism from sales school that says
you can&rsquo;t shoot a deer from the lodge. The same goes for learning: you
have to suit up, get out the door, and find what you&rsquo;re after. Mastery,
especially of complex ideas, skills, and processes, is a quest. It is
not a grade on a test, something bestowed by a coach, or a quality that
simply seeps into your being with old age and gray hair.</p>
<p><code>Embrace the notion of successful intelligence</code> Go Wide: don&rsquo;t roost in
a pigeonhole of your preferred learning style but take command of your
resources and tap all of your &ldquo;intelligences&rdquo; to master the knowledge or
skill you want to possess. Describe what you want to know, do, or
accomplish. Then list the competencies required, what you need to learn,
and where you can find the knowledge or skill. Then go get it. Consider
your expertise to be in a state of continuing development, practice
dynamic testing as a learning strategy to discover your weaknesses, and
focus on improving yourself in those areas. It&rsquo;s smart to build on your
strengths, but you will become ever more competent and versatile if you
also use testing and trial and error to continue to improve in the areas
where your knowldege or performance are not pulling their weight.</p>
<p><strong>Adopt active learning strategies</strong> like retrieval practice, spacing, and
interleaving. Be aggressive.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t rely on what feels best: like a good pilot checking his
instruments, use quizzing, peer review, and the other tools described
<strong>AVOID ILLUSIONS OF KNOWING</strong> to make sure your judgment of what you know
and can do is accurate, and that your strategies are moving you toward
your goals. Don&rsquo;t assume that you&rsquo;re doing something wrong if the
learning feels hard. Remember that difficulties you can overcome with
grater cognitive effort will more than repay you in the depth and
durability of your learning.</p>
<p><code>Distill the underlying principles; build the structure</code> If you&rsquo;re an
example learner, study examples two at a time or more, rather than one
by one, asking yourself in what ways they are alike and different. Are
the differences such that they require different solutions, or are the
similarities such that they respond to a common solution?</p>
<p>Break your idea or desired competency down into its component parts. If
you think you are a low structure-builder or an example learner trying
to learn new material, pause periodically and ask what the central ideas
are, what the rules are. Describe each idea and recall the related
points. Which are the big ideas, and which are supporting concepts or
nuances? If you were to test yourself on the main ideas, how would you
describe them?</p>
<p>Structure is all around us and available to us through the poet&rsquo;s medium
of metaphor. A tree, with its roots, trunk, and branches.</p>
<p>By abstracting the underlying rules and piecing them into a structure,
you go for more than knowledge. You go for know-how. And that kind of
mastery will put you ahead.</p>

<h3 id="is-iq-mutable">Is IQ Mutable?</h3>
<p>Gains in IQ were found in several areas of cognitive training. ### Brain
Training Since it&rsquo;s unlikely I&rsquo;ll be raising my IQ anytime soon, are
there strategies or behaviors that can serve as *cognitive
*&ldquo;multipliers&rdquo; to amp up the performance of the intelligence I&rsquo;ve
already got? Yes. Here are three: embracing a <strong>growth mindset,
practicing like an expert, and constructing memory cues.</strong></p>
<h3 id="growth-mindset">Growth Mindset</h3>
<p>Attitude counts for a lot. More than IQ, it&rsquo;s discipline, grit, and a
growth mindset that imbue a person with the sense of possibility and the
creativity and persistence needed for higher learning and success.</p>
<h3 id="deliberate-practice">Deliberate Practice</h3>
<p>Deliberate practice is goal directed, often solitary, and consists of
repeated striving to reach beyond your current level of performance.
Whatever the field, expert performance is thought to be garnered through
the slow acquisition of a larger number of increasingly complex
patterns, patterns that are used to store knowledge about which actions
to take in a vast vocabulary of different situations.</p>
<p>The central idea here is that expert performance is a product of the
<code>quantity</code> and the <code>quality</code> of practice, not of genetic predisposition,
and that becoming expert is not beyond the reach of normally gifted
people who have the motivation, time, and discipline to pursue it.</p>
<h3 id="memory-cues">Memory cues</h3>
<p>Image cue memories. With continued retrieval, complex material can
become second nature to a person and the mnemonic cues are no longer
needed: you consolidate concepts like Newton&rsquo;s 3 laws of motion into
mental models that you use as a kind of short-hand. Through repeated
use, your brain encodes and &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; sequences of motor and cognitive
actions, and your ability to recall and apply them becomes as automatic
as habit.</p>
<h3 id="the-takeaway-4">The Takeaway</h3>
<p><strong>Effortful learning changes the brain,</strong> building new connections and
capability. This single fact - that our intellectual abilities are not
fixed from birth but are, to a considerable degree, outs to shape - is a
resounding answer to the nagging voice that too often asks us &ldquo;Why
bother?&rdquo; We make the effort because the effort itself extends the
boundaries of our abilities. What we do shapes who we become and what
we&rsquo;re capable of doing. The more we do, the more we can do. To embrace
this principle and reap its benefits is to be sustained through life by
a <strong>growth mindset.</strong></p>
<p>And it comes down to the simple fact that the path to complex master or
expert performance does not necessarily start from exceptional genes,
but it most certainly entails <strong>self-discipline, grit, and persistence;</strong>
with these qualities in healthy measure, if you want to become an
expert, you probably can. And whatever you are striving to master,
whether it&rsquo;s a poem you wrote for a friend&rsquo;s birthday, the concept of
classical conditioning in psychology, *conscious mnemonic devices *can
help to organize and cue the learning for ready retrieval until
sustained, deliberate practice and repeated use form the deeper encoding
and subconscious mastery that characterize expert performance.</p>
<h2 id="ch8-make-it-stick">Ch8, Make It Stick</h2>
<h3 id="learning-tips-for-students">Learning Tips for Students</h3>
<p>Embrace the fact that significant learning is often, or even usually,
somewhat difficult. You will experience setbacks. These are signs of
effort, not of failure. Setbacks come with striving, and striving builds
expertise. Effortful learning changes your brain, making new
connections, building mental models. increasing your capability. Your
intellectual abilities lie to a large degree within your own control.
Knowing that this is so makes the difficulties worth tackling. Following
are three keystone study strategies. Make a habit of them and structure
your time so as to pursue them with regularity. #### Practice Retrieving
New Learning from Memory &ldquo;Retrieval practice&rdquo; means self-quizzing.
Retrieving knowledge and skill from memory should become your primary
study strategy in place of rereading.</p>
<p><strong>How to use retrieval practice as a study strategy:</strong> When you read a
text or study lecture notes, pause periodically to ask yourself
questions like these, without looking in the text: What are the key
ideas? What terms or ideas are new to me? How would I define them? How
do the ideas relate to what I already know?</p>
<p>Many textbooks have study questions at the ends of the chapters, and
these are good fodder for self-quizzing. Generating questions for
yourself and writing down the answers is also a good way to study.</p>
<p>Set aside a little time every week throughout the semester to quiz
yourself on the material in a course, both the current week&rsquo;s work and
material covered in prior weeks. When you quiz yourself, check your
answers to make sure that your judgments of what you know and don&rsquo;t know
are accurate.</p>
<p>Use quizzing to identify areas of weak mastery, and focus your studying
to make them strong.</p>
<p>The harder ti is for you to recall new learning from memory, the greater
the benefit of doing so. Making errors will not set you back, so long as
you check your answers and correct your mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>What your intuition tells you to do:</strong> Most students focus on
underlining and highlighting text and lecture notes and slides. They
dedicate their time to rereading these, becoming fluent in the text and
terminology, because this feels like learning. <strong>Why retrieval practice
is better:</strong> After one or two reviews of a text, self-quizzing is far
more potent for learning than additional rereading. Why might this be
so? This is explained more fully in Chapter 2, but here are some of the
high points. The familiarity with a text that is gained from rereading
creates illusions of knowing, but these are not reliable indicators of
mastery of the material. Fluency with a text has two strikes against it:
it is a misleading indicator of what you have learned, and it crates the
false impresion that you will remember the material. By contrast,
quizzing yourself on the main ideas and the meanings behind the terms
helps you to focus on the central precepts rather than on peripheral
material or on a professor&rsquo;s turn of phrase.Quizzing provide a reliable
measure of what you&rsquo;ve learned and what you haven&rsquo;t yet mastered.
Moreover, quizzing arrests forgetting. Forgetting is human nature, but
practice at recalling new learning secures it in memory and helps you
recall it in the future. Periodically practicing new knowledge and
skills through self-quizzing strengthens your learning of it and your
ability to connect it to prior knowledge. A habit of regular retrieval
practice throughout the duration of a course puts an end to cramming and
all-nighters. You will need little studying at exam time. Reviewing the
material the night before is much easier than learning it. <strong>How it
feels:</strong> Compared to rereading, self-quizzing can feel awkward and
frustrating, especially when the new learning is hard to recall. It does
not feel as productive as rereading your class notes and highlighted
passages of text feels. But what you don&rsquo;t sense when you&rsquo;re struggling
to retrieve new learning is the fact that every time you work hard to
recall a memory, you actually strengthen it. If you restudy something
after failing to recall it, you actually learn it better than if you had
not tried to recall it. The effort of retrieving knowledge or skills
strengthens its staying power and your ability to recall it in the
future.</p>
<h4 id="space-out-your-retrieval-practice">Space Out Your Retrieval Practice</h4>
<p><strong>What does this mean:</strong> Spaced practice means studying information more
than once but leaving considerable time between practice sessions. <strong>How
to use spaced practice as a study strategy:</strong> Establish a schedule of
self-quizzing that allows time to elapse between study sessions. How
much time? It depends on the material. If you are learning a set of
names and faces, you will need to review them within a few minutes of
your first encounter, because these associations are forgotten quickly.
New material in a text may need to be revisited within a day or so of
your first encounter with it. Then, perhaps not again for several days
or a week. When you are feeling more sure of your mastery of certain
material, quiz yourself on it once a month. Over the course of a
semester, as you quiz yourself on new material, also reach back to
retrieve prior material and ask yourself how that knowledge relates to
what you have subsequently learned. Anything you want to remember must
be periodically recalled from memory.</p>
<p>Another way of spacing retrieval practice is to interleave the study of
two or more topics, so that alternating between them requires that you
continually refresh your mind on each topic as you return to it.</p>
<p><strong>What your intuition tells you to do:</strong> Intuition persuades us to
dedicate stretches of time to single-minded, repetitive practice of
something we want to master, the massed &ldquo;practice-practice-practice&rdquo;
regime we have been led to believe is essential for building mastery of
a skill or learning new knowledge. These intuitions are compelling and
hard to distrust for two reasons. First, as we practice a thing over and
over we often see our performance improving, which serves as a powerful
reinforcement of this strategy. Second, we fail to see that the gains
made during single-minded repetitive practice come from short-term
memory and quickly fade. Our failure to perceive how quickly the gains
fade leaves us with the impression that massed practice is productive.</p>
<p><strong>Why spaced practice is better</strong>: It&rsquo;s a common but mistaken belief that
you can burn something into memory through sheer repetition. Lots of
practice works, but only if it&rsquo;s spaced.</p>
<p>If you use self-quizzing as your primary study strategy and space out
your study sessions so that a little forgetting has happened since your
last practice, you will have to work harder to reconstruct what you
already studied. If effect, you&rsquo;re &ldquo;re-loading&rdquo; it from long-term
memory. This effort to reconstruct the learning makes the important
ideas more salient and memorable and connects them more securely to
other knowledge and to more recent learning.</p>
<p><strong>How it feels:</strong> Massed practice feels more productive than spaced
practice, but it is not. Spaced practice feels more difficult, because
you have gotten a little rusty and the material is harder to recall. It
feels like you&rsquo;re not really getting on top of it,</p>
<h4 id="interleave-the-study-of-different-problem-types">Interleave the Study of Different Problem Types</h4>
<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong> If you&rsquo;re trying to learn mathematical formulas,
study more than one type at a time, so that you are alternating between
different problems that call for different solutions. If you are
studying biology specimens, Dutch painters, or the principles of
macroeconomics, mix up the examples. <strong>How to use interleaved practice as
a study strategy:</strong> Many textbooks are structured in study blocks: THey
present the solution to a particular kind of problem, say, computing the
volume of a spheroid, and supply many examples to solve before moving to
another kind of problem (computing the volume of a cone). Blocked
practice is not as effective as interleaved practice, so here&rsquo;s what to
do. When you structure your study regimen, once you reach the point
where you understand a new problem type and its solution but your grasp
of it is still rudimentary, scatter this problem type throughout your
practice sequence so that you are alternately quizzing yourself on
various problem types and retrieving the appropriate solutions for each.
If you find yourself falling into single-minded, repetitive practice of
a particular topic or skill, change it up: mix in the practice of other
subjects, other skills, constantly challenging your ability to recognize
the problem type and select the right solution. <strong>What your intuition
tells you to do:</strong> Most learners focus on many examples of one problem or
specimen type at a time, wanting to master the type and &ldquo;get it down
cold&rdquo; before moving on to study another type. <strong>Why interleaved practice
is better:</strong> Mixing up problem types improves your ability to
discriminate between types, identify the unifying characteristics within
a type, and improves your success in a later test where you must discern
the kind of problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve in order to apply the correct
solution.</p>
<h4 id="other-effective-study-strategies">Other Effective Study Strategies</h4>
<p>ELABORATION It improves your mastery of new material and multiplies the
mental cues available to you for later recall and application of it.
*What is it?*Elaboration is the process of finding additional layers of
meaning in new material.Examples include relating the material to what
you already know, explaining it to somebody else in your own words, or
explaining how it relates to your life outside of class. A powerful form
of elaboration is to discover a metaphor or visual image for the new
material.</p>
<p>GENERATION It has the effect of making the mind more receptive to new
learning. <strong>What is it?</strong> Generation is an attempt to answer a question or
solve a problem before being shown the answer or the solution For
instance, on a small level, the act of filling in a missing word in a
text results in better learning and memory of the text than simply
reading a complete text. You can practice generation when reading new
class material by trying to explain beforehand the key ideas you expect
to find in the material and how you expect they will relate to your
prior knowledge. If you&rsquo;re in a science or math course learning
different types of solutions for different types of problems, try to
solve the problems before you get to class.</p>
<p>REFLECTION It is a combination of retrieval practice and elaboration
that adds layers to learning and strengthens skills. <strong>What is it?</strong>
Reflection is the act of taking a few minutes to review what has been
learned in a recent class or experience and asking yourself question.
What went well? What could have gone better? What other knowledge or
experiences does it remind you of? What might you need to learn for
better mastery, or what strategies might you use the next time to get
better results?</p>
<p>CALIBRATION It is the act of aligning your judgments of what you know
and don&rsquo;t know with objective feedback so as to avoid being carried off
by the illusions of mastery that catch many learners by surprise at test
time. <strong>What is it?</strong> Everyone is subject to a host of cognitive
illusions. Mistaking fluency with a text for mastery of the underlying
content is just one example. Calibration is simply the act of using an
objective instrument to clear away illusions and adjust your judgment to
better reflect reality. The aim is to be sure that your sense of what
you know and can do is accurate.</p>
<p>MNEMONIC DEVICES They help you to retrieve what you have learned and to
hold arbitrary information in memory. <strong>What are they?</strong> &ldquo;Mnemonic&rdquo; is
from the Greek word for memory, and mnemonic devices are like mental
file cabinets. They give you handy ways to store information and find it
again when you need it.</p>
